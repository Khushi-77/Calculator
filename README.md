Hi everyone! I'm excited to share my latest project, a simple calculator application that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The primary goal of this calculator is to provide users with a quick and efficient way to perform basic arithmetic operations. Whether you need to add up expenses, calculate percentages, or divide numbers, this calculator has got you covered!

Features:
ðŸ”¢ Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for basic arithmetic.
ðŸ”¢ Includes a clear button to easily reset calculations.
ðŸ”¢ Displays the current calculation on the screen for a seamless user experience.
ðŸ”¢ Responsive design ensures it looks great on all devices, from desktop to mobile.
